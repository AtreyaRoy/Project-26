First we need to add 3 cups of sooji mixed with 1.5 cups of yogurt.
add sambar masala,chopped green chilli and onion and the corriondor leaves.
add water and salt to it and then stir it for some time.
keep it aside for about 30 minutes.
we have to take a non-stick tawa.
we have to brush some white oil in it.
we have to light out gas and heat the tawa for some time.
pour some mixture in the tawa.
we have to spread the mixture gently to make a round shape.
when the side facing the tawa gets cooked we have to turn the uttapam the other side.
we have to put some butter, black pepper and if you like you can add cheese over here.
your uttapam is ready to be served to the guest.
and eat it with chutney of your choice and flavour or you can eat it with sauce or you can relish it with out sauce or chutney.
